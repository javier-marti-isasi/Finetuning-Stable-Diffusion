# Finetuning-Stable-Diffusion 2.0 and 1.5
Finetuning and inference of Stable Diffusion 2.0 and Stable Diffusion 1.5 with AUTOMATIC1111 and DreamBooth.

Stable Diffusion is an open source text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from CompVis, Stability AI and LAION. It's trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B database. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 10GB VRAM.
